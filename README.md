# XYZ Reader
XYZ Reader displays a list of articles that the user can read. 
As a part of Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree, I redesigned the app to follow the Material Design 
guidelines and translated a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app. The app including 
support for older API versions and features animations and transitions for devices higher than Lollipop.


##Things I learned

* Understanding the fundamentals of Android design.
* Applying Material Design guidelines to a mobile application.
* Separating an interface into surfaces.
* Effectively using transitions and motion.

## Getting Started

* Clone the project typing the following command in the git-bash/terminal
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/dalmia/XYZ-Reader.git
    ```

* Run the project using the `/gradlew` command from the terminal in Android Studio or click on the `Import a new Project` option from the File menu.
